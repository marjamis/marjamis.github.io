A place for me to try to explain things I've learnt or as a wrapper to other bits of code, such as in GitHub gists. While I strive for accuracy in all things I can't guarantee this so please take with a grain of salt and don't hesitate to [create PR's](https://github.com/marjamis/marjamis.github.io) for things you know are wrong.
