## Some key concepts that I'd like to follow up with one day

- The time taken for every step of a piece of works journey, and how we can improve these to be more efficient. Such as:
  - Reducing batch sizes i.e. getting to production quicker. An example of something that help with this being WIP limits (as seen in Kanban boards)
  - Reducing lead time i.e. the time from the initial request of work until its started
  - Reducing process time i.e. the time from the start of the work until its completed
- Reducing waste
  - How do we find out where is the waste in our processes?
  - How do we eliminate this waste? Simplified processes, greater automation, etc
- What are your value streams? Whats the point of your work?
  - How do you process feedback? How do improve on those issues ASAP to improve your value steam? i.e. not delegating to a later time or for another team but "swarming" to solve these issues quickly
