## Project Planning

**Note:** Always incorporate [Design Thinking](https://www.education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/key-learning-areas/stem/early-stage-1-to-stage-3/project-based-learning-and-design-thinking/phases-of-design-thinking) into the process.

### Project Management Phases

#### 1 - Initiate

* Lots of projects are due to systemic flaws and have greater reach than expected. Look into the 5 why's of a project to see if there are underlying fixes that would elliminate these issues
* Define problem statetement, scope & objectives. Working backwards from the users/customers
* Once the above is outlined, have a mission statement and a reason why this thing should exist. This will be your guiding light on how to proceed throughout the implementation
* Use data to sway people. If you dont have it ask and discuss if there is even better data to prove, or possibly disprove, your path forward. Some data is better than no data
* What are you trying to do and how does this fit in with the businesses current and future needs?

##### 1.5 Discovery phase

#### 2 - Plan

* Get buy-in from your stakeholders, without this you have no place to go
* Define timelines, dates, and milestones . This should have slack built into it but also be aggressive enough that actions are taken
  * When creating metrics ensure the metric isn't the cause and try reverse the equation to see if it's a real cause. Read more into this.
* What are the projects success metrics?

#### 3 - Execute

* Create a wiki and document your:
  * Mission Statement
  * Tenets
  * Objectives
  * An FAQ section that can be updated overtime with questions that people ask
  * A training section preparing to show people how to use the project, or other required aspects of the project
  * [Guide to creating leadership and governance of a project](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/)
* Create a tracker of issues and something like a sprint board for showing progress and current assignements. This should be defined by the timeline and required outputs
* Write up a basic plan for running meetings and what should be involved. For more details look into documents created by McKenzie

#### 4 - Close

* Finalise the project and discuss what worked, what didn't, etc
* Questions to ask and document on the wiki as part of the wrap up:
  * Did the project fix the issue that created the project?
  * How well did it work versus expecations?
  * What learnings came from the project?
  * What would you do differently?

##### 4.5 Monitoring & Control phase

* Set alarm thresholds but review in case these change over time. Automated reviews are best, where possible, for confirming new values. These should also match up to the success metrics of the project as a whole
* Outcomes over output basically ensure the metrics are driving the results I want rather than metric that just say it happened. For example, feature releases are fine but what were there outcomes? Such a documented reduction in TOIL rather than we released 5 features. As usual, Martin Fowler is a good source of information surround this with [Outcome Over Output]( https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOverOutput.html)
