ingredients:
- 1 seeded, peeled, cubed butternut pumpkin
- 2 peeled, diced onions
- 1 large peeled, cubed  potato
- 1 litre water
- 1 teaspoon each rosemary, thyme, mixed herbs
- 2 teaspoons turmeric
- salt and pepper

steps:
- Boil ingredients, including spices,  in water until soft.
- Ladle pumpkin mixture with half the water from boiling  into blender and blend until smooth an all ingredients are integrated. If you want a thinner soup add more of the pumpkin broth.
- Save the left over broth for use in other recipes but don't keep it  more than a week.
- Reheat soup on low heat. Add more salt and pepper if you like.  Top with fresh chopped parsley if you like or a dob of yoghurt/cream/sour cream. 
- Variation - Instead of pumpkin use other vegetables such a broccoli or cauliflower. Use 1/2 litre water but after blending add 1 can of coconut milk for a creamier
