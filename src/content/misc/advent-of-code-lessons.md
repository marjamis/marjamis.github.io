## Patterns

### Create distributions of data

#### When to use

- If the data can be grouped together, either by the inputs or expected outputs. i.e. don't treat each "object" separately but rather treat the group as a whole
- Simple calculations can be used to perform the work instead of laborious "simulation" via iterating

#### Examples

- [Year 2021 - Day 6 - Part 2](https://github.com/marjamis/advent-of-code/blob/main/internal/pkg/advent2021/day6.go#L58-L82)
