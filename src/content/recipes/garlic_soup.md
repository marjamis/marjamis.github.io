ingredients:
- 7 maybe 20 garlic cloves, peeled 
- 100ml extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve 
- 3 shallots, finely sliced 
- 2 cloves 
- ½ tsp hot smoked paprika (pimentón picante) 
- 5 sprigs fresh thyme 
- 2 bay leaves 
- 12 cherry tomatoes, halved 
- 1.5 litres chicken stock
- splash sherry vinegar (optional) 
- 2-3 slices sourdough bread
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 free-range eggs
- 100g parmesan or hard Manchego cheese, grated

steps:
- Place the garlic cloves in a small pan and cover with the extra virgin olive oil. Place on a medium heat until the oil begins to bubble gently. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and cook the garlic gently for 25 minutes, or until the cloves are soft. Remove from the heat and remove the garlic using a slotted spoon.
- Push the garlic through a sieve and reserve. (You can keep the garlic oil to use for cooking risottos, stews, fried eggs etc. It will keep for several weeks in the fridge.)
- In a large saucepan, heat 1 tbsp of the garlic-infused olive oil and gently fry the shallots for 5-6 minutes. Add the reserved garlic purée, cloves, paprika, thyme, bay leaves and tomatoes. Fry gently for a further five minutes, then pour in the chicken stock. Simmer the broth on a low heat for 30 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. You may like to add a splash of sherry vinegar.
- To serve, toast the sourdough so that it is slightly charred. Tear the toast up into bite-sized chunks and put in the bottom of heated soup bowls. Season the hot broth with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then pour it over the toasts in the bowls.
- Carefully break open an egg into each bowl of broth, and serve immediately with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and the grated cheese in a bowl to hand round the table.
- Note - The egg will cook in the hot broth, but if you are squeamish about runny eggs, poach the eggs in the soup for a few minutes before serving. Alternatively poach them separately, before adding to the broth. The Spanish wouldn't dream of cooking the eggs separately.
