ingredients:
  - 250g Butternut Snap Cookies
  - 100g butter, melted
  - 200g frozen raspberries, thawed
  - 200g frozen strawberries
  - 2 x 250g cream cheese
  - 220g caster sugar
  - 300ml thickened cream
  - Fresh berries, to serve with

steps:
  - Grease and line the base and side of a 20cm springform pan with baking paper.
  - Place the biscuits in a food processor until finely chopped. Add the melted butter and process until well combined. Spoon evenly in the base of the pan, pressing evenly with base of a glass and then place in a freezer to set.
  - Place the frozen strawberries in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring and using the back of a spoon to crush for 2-3 minutes until the strawberries break down. Remove from heat. Use a fork to finely mash. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl, using the back of the spoon to push through as much pulp as possible. Repeat with the raspberries, setting each puree in separate bowls.
  - Place the cream cheese and sugar in the food processor and process until smooth. Add the cream and process again until smooth. Divide the cream cheese mixture evenly in 2 mixing bowls. Add the strawberry puree to 1 bowl to combine. Pour into the base of the prepared pan and then place in freezer until firm, usually about 2hours.
  - Add the raspberry puree to the other cream chees mixture and stir to combine. Pour evenly over the set strawberry mixture and then place in the freezer for a further 4 hours or until completely set.
  - Remove from the pan and serve with fresh berries.
