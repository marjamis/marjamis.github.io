Ever had to get an image manifest for a docker image in a repository before or other information from the registry directly? I know I have. Here's how you can achieve this with curl.

To access this type of information from the Docker Hub registry you can use:

import GitHubGist from "../../components/GitHubGist.astro";

<GitHubGist id="fe812a8657b714efb48b16204801d9cf" file="docker_registry.sh" />

How about from ECR? Boy have I!

<GitHubGist id="fe812a8657b714efb48b16204801d9cf" file="ecr_registry.sh" />

And there you go, an easy way to use curl to authenticate to a compatible docker registry and retrieve data for an images manifest and the tags associated with a repository. No fuss, no muss.

For more information about what other data is available via this method, try having a look at the [Docker Registry API reference](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/).
