Here is an example of how to make authenticated GitHub GraphQL queries to obtain information with a basic loop for paginated results. This is only a reference for simple requirements and anything more advanced probably **shouldn't** be a bash script.

More information about the format for queries and the API can be found at [GitHub's GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) documentation.

Script:

import GitHubGist from "../../components/GitHubGist.astro";

<GitHubGist id="2b0088ead7fcb6ea2ccfb196818b2be6" file="githubGraphQL.sh" />
<GitHubGist id="2b0088ead7fcb6ea2ccfb196818b2be6" file="sample.query" />
