An amazingly large part of the IT industry is change. Just think about what IT looked like 5 years ago? 10 years ago? 20 years ago? There just really isn't much comparison to the extent of change that has happened in the IT industry over the decades. As a result of this, people have been often left out of the equation which has caused multiple issues, such as burnout and continuation of bad practices.

With that in mind it becomes important for organisations to adapt to change from both a technological perspective and a people perspective. This realisation started to happen during COVID-19, and even a bit before then, where organisations are recognising people are at the heart of what we do and that we have a responsibility to promote the best way of treating everyone involved.

This section will document some of the ways how Technical Leadership is important to IT for customers, employees, and the community at large as well. We will also delve into ways to manage change to deliver the best possible outcomes.
